I went to [defcon](http://defcon.org/) for the first time, and it was probably one of the
best experiences of my life, if not the best. Here are some
notes to self for the second time that might help another first-timer
next time around.


## Talks {#talks}

I only went to one, and I probably won't go to that many next
time. Most talks are published, and while they're the sorts of talks
that grab 100% of my attention, I feel [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) watching them versus
doing things that I cannot do later.

Next time, I'll try to attend [BSides](https://bsideslv.org/) to get to some [skytalks](https://skytalks.info/).


## Villages {#villages}

I visited some villages, and they were _very_ interesting. My particular
interests were blue teaming, red teaming, and packet hacking, but then
again, **everything** at DEFCON is interesting.

Next time, I need to memorize the map. The [hackertracker](https://hackertracker.app/) app, the
brochure, and even the badge had a map of LVCC in them, but they still
were not enough when someone messages "come to aisle 4" in reference
to a giant 3 story building with 30-something-thousand people in it.


## CTFs {#ctfs}

Come prepared. I was not. I competed in the [RTV CTF](https://redteamvillage.io/ctf.html) this year with
some very smart people, and while we did not get a high rank, I still
managed to solve a few challenges.

Bring a live "everything" Kali USB drive
: You can do most things
    with some apps, but Kali's ["everything" version](https://9to5linux.com/kali-linux-2022-1-released-with-new-everything-flavor-new-tools-and-a-visual-refresh) has things
    included. The DEFCON wifi was acting very strange and slow, and I
    couldn't download a bunch of tools like [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) or [sqlmap](https://sqlmap.org/) due to how
    slow the wifi was. Additionally, you can boot off of a live USB
    drive in QEMU, at least if you're on Linux, so the host could be
    doing other things while you solve challenges in a VM.

Get a better charger
: My [charger/powerbank brick](https://www.anker.com/products/a1651?ref=ganprime_top_itemlist&variant=41974350250134) takes up more
    than half of the space of a power strip. It's especially
    inconvenient when sitting at a table with several people.

Bring an ethernet cable
: While some of the villages have their own
    (i.e. packet hacking) The contest area did not have any ethernet
    cables. It was not a necessity, but for better connectivity or
    connecting to particular routers it would've helped.

Download wikipedia
: Again, the internet outage was a big
    issue. Most things I looked up ([default ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers), [magic bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures), [heapq
    implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)#Programming_language_implementations)) took me to Wikipedia, so a simple local version of
    Wikipedia would've been very handy with something like [kiwix](https://kiwix.org/en/).

Practice
: I... don't practice CTFs, and I think that was the major
    hurdle for me, personally. Practice makes permanent, and muscle
    memory or some sort of automated script would take care of
    low-hanging fruits so that I can focus on my favorite section
    instead (reverse engineering).

Coordinate
: You know it's a bad sign as the title at my day job is
    "IT Coordinator" and I still don't know how to coordinate. 3 friends
    of mine participated in 3 different CTFs, and I wanted to do
    all 3. There's no rule against doing multiple CTFs, but preparation
    and coordinating with them would've been nice.


## Parties {#parties}

There were way too many parties by DEFCON, by villages, or by
other people I was invited to. Make sure to plan in advance instead of
doing what I did, which was to go to a pool party last minute with
jeans and a backpack.

So, a few tips would be to:

-   Pack some shorts and swimsuit.
-   Check whether you'd need to drive or just walk, and if driving,
    find parking nearby. I had to spend too much time finding cheap
    parking around the Vegas strip.
-   Drink more. I drank a lot (Redbull, coffee, vodka, whiskey,
    beer, and a little bit of water on the side), but there's always
    room for more.
-   Talk to people. I spent most of my time with people I knew, and
    talked to a very few new people. The very few people that I met were
    some of the most interesting who, despite being humble and
    down-to-earth, were very smart and knowledgeable. If you're going to
    a DEFCON party, talk to as many people as you can.
