Starbucks, because it&rsquo;s pricey and has never tasted good (to me). There are some
great <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-wave_coffee>3rd wave</a> cafe&rsquo;s near me, but then again, I can&rsquo;t leave the
office 5 times a day to buy a fresh shot and come back.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll go over the recipe first, and will then explain my
reasoning. Keep in mind that I&rsquo;m an absolute novice, so take
everything here with a grain of salt.</p><h2 id=the-recipe>The recipe</h2><ol><li>Grind your coffee fine-ish. ≈450-500 \(\micro m\)</li><li>Boil your water to 80°-90° Celsius</li><li>Put the AeroPress filter in, lock the filter piece.</li><li>Pour in the coffee ground.</li><li>Pour 70-80 milliliters of water.</li><li>Stir <strong>AND</strong> swirl.</li><li>Swirl again around 3:30 minutes to remove the foam.</li><li>Drink it at around the 4:00 minute mark.</li></ol><h2 id=reasoning>Reasoning</h2><dl><dt>Grind</dt><dd>This was a personal choice, but the reason I went with a
finer ground was more flavor. This is, in a sense, a misuse of this
product, because almost every tutorial and the manual discourage you
from pressing too hard with a fine grind, but it seemed to have
resulted in a better taste (for me). Another thing to note is that I
haven&rsquo;t calibrated my grinder (<a href=https://1zpresso.coffee/k-ultra/>k-ultra</a>) in a while, so those micron
figures may not be exact.</dd><dt>Water</dt><dd>I just go with 80° for dark roasts, and closer to
90° for light to medium.</dd><dt>Filter</dt><dd>I use the paper filter, but <a href=https://aeropress.com/blogs/blog/aeropress-metal-filter-vs-paper-filters>according to AeroPress'
website</a>, the metal filter is better for this style, since the
metal lets in more of the oil and will result in a better texture.</dd><dt>Ratio</dt><dd>The manual only says go up to the first circle, which is
not an exact amount. For me 70-80 was around there, and the
confusing part might be that prior to stirring, the water is not
level, so it&rsquo;s hard to know how much to pour. Most sources out there
recommended more than 15g of coffee, but for me 15g was already
plenty of extraction.</dd><dt>Stirring</dt><dd>In the Pourover videos and the AeroPress videos by James
Hoffmann, he recommends swirl over stirring. I personally <em>feel</em> like
I&rsquo;m getting more extraction doing stirring first to spread the
ground and then swirl, but it could very well be confirmation
bias.</dd><dt>Timing</dt><dd>Once again, this was based on James Hoffmann&rsquo;s AeroPress
video. Although he shows that the extraction isn&rsquo;t as fast after ≈
2:00 minutes, I felt a noticeably better taste after 3:30 minutes, which might
not have to do with extraction.</dd></dl><p>You might&rsquo;ve also noticed I didn&rsquo;t try the inverted method. It&rsquo;s not
because of any scientific evidence or experiments; I&rsquo;m just too scared
to do that on the same desk that I have my laptop on.</p><h2 id=resources>Resources</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0601/8783/6659/files/AeroPress_Go_instructions-April_2023-English.pdf?v=1682116759">The AeroPress Go Manual</a>, which is because I got the &ldquo;Go&rdquo; version. I
checked the other manuals, and they don&rsquo;t seem to have the
espresso-style. Regardless, this is what I initially started with
and deviated to get more extraction.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://www.javapresse.com/blogs/aeropress/can-aeropress-make-espresso>These</a> <a href=https://www.javapresse.com/blogs/aeropress/aeropress-espresso-recipe>two</a> blog posts were amazing. The recipe is different than
mine,
but they&rsquo;re very valuable in terms of information.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://coffeechronicler.com/aeropress-espresso/>This blog post</a> mentions a more similar to mine, but uses the
inverted method and has a shorter wait time (though more than the
previous website). The most interesting thing mentioned here is the
pressure is not directly correlated to extraction, which is what
enables one to actually brew something similar to the espresso with
the AeroPress.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://aeropress.com/blogs/blog/aeropress-espresso>The official website</a>, which has a much higher coffee→ water ratio
than mine, similar to the other sources, but the water temperature is
closer.</p></li><li><p>Most importantly, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ>James Hoffmann</a> and <a href=https://aeromatic.app/recipes/james-hoffmann-espresso-aeropress-recipe>his recipe</a>. One distinction to
note is that this is older than his
<a href="https://youtu.be/jBXm8fCWdo8?si=G8kKbb8tSRq5i2X5&amp;t=130">&ldquo;Understanding
The AeroPress&rdquo;</a> video (timestamped), which goes over extraction
over time, which is my most important deviation compared to other
techniques.</p></li><li><p>I&rsquo;ll have to retry these things once I get the metal filter, but
I&rsquo;ll keep researching and trying different things. Everyone has
their own taste, but hearing about new techniques and perspectives
is always refreshing. It makes wonder if I&rsquo;d need a comment section
on this blog&mldr;</p></li></ul><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/blog/tags/coffee/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">Coffee</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/blog/tags/aeropress/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">Aeropress</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/blog/tags/food/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">Food</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://arian-d.github.io/blog/>&copy; Arian's blog 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
