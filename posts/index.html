I can&rsquo;t afford one. I&rsquo;m not willing to spend that much money, if I could afford one. If I was willing to buy one and could afford it, I wouldn&rsquo;t wanna bring it to the office, since I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use it at home. So, what can I do? I&rsquo;m not willing to pay someone to make it for me at Starbucks, because it&rsquo;s pricey and has never tasted good (to me).</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/ai-on-a-laptop/ class="link black dim">AI on a laptop</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The AI craze is going strong. You would think it&rsquo;d be over by now, but big boy companies keep throwing their money at Nvidia GPUs and overpriced LLM subscriptions.
For the average Joe, GPT4 and GPT4o are more than enough to do your day-to-day tasks or if you&rsquo;re a developer, you can just have OpenAI&rsquo;s API do everything you&rsquo;re too lazy to do. This all comes at a cost:

There&rsquo;s also things that solve so much that aren&rsquo;t used as often.
Recently, I&rsquo;ve been relying on ??, which is a very interesting operator called &ldquo;null-coalescing operator&rdquo;. A fairly seasoned programmer probably uses it very often and wouldn&rsquo;t find this as fascinating as I did, but for me, it&rsquo;s a game-changer.
Take this for instance:

This is one of those use-cases where I can use ngrok to freely demo my app without having to set up a cloud instance or open up a port in my router. The simple usage of running ngrok is fine for simple cases like hosting a minecraft server for an hour, but if you need to run it in the background you&rsquo;d need a service.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/steam-deck/ class="link black dim">Steam Deck: The Linux User's Dream</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When I received my Steam Deck about -checks Steam account- 3 months ago, I was already aware of what it was capable of, considering that I had been browsing r/SteamDeck while waiting for it.

I frankly don&rsquo;t know where to begin, but I am glad you somehow found your way here.
Why The entire reason behind me starting this was a braindump. You may share the same experience of gulping down a large amount of coffee, flexing your fingers, and browsing the web or frantically coding away at your mechanical keyboard.
