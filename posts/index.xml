best experiences of my life, if not the best. Here are some
notes to self for the second time that might help another first-timer
next time around.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="talks">Talks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I only went to one, and I probably won&amp;rsquo;t go to that many next
time. Most talks are published, and while they&amp;rsquo;re the sorts of talks
that grab 100% of my attention, I feel &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO&lt;/a> watching them versus
doing things that I cannot do later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A mediocre pseudo-espresso recipe with the AeroPress</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/aeropress-recipe/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/aeropress-recipe/</guid><description>&lt;p>A real espresso requires an espresso machine, and that&amp;rsquo;s somewhat
inconvenient for an average Joe like me, because&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I can&amp;rsquo;t afford one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to spend that much money, if I could afford one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If I was willing to buy one and could afford it, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t wanna
bring it to the office, since I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to use it at home.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, what can I do? I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to pay someone to make it for me at
Starbucks, because it&amp;rsquo;s pricey and has never tasted good (to me). There are some
great &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-wave_coffee">3rd wave&lt;/a> cafe&amp;rsquo;s near me, but then again, I can&amp;rsquo;t leave the
office 5 times a day to buy a fresh shot and come back.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI on a laptop</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/ai-on-a-laptop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/ai-on-a-laptop/</guid><description>&lt;p>The AI craze is going strong. You would think it&amp;rsquo;d be over by now, but
big boy companies keep throwing their money at Nvidia GPUs and
overpriced LLM subscriptions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the average Joe, GPT4 and GPT4o are more than enough to do your
day-to-day tasks or if you&amp;rsquo;re a developer, you can just have OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s
API do everything you&amp;rsquo;re too lazy to do. This all comes at a cost:&lt;/p>
&lt;dl>
&lt;dt>Data privacy&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>Are you okay sending your or your company&amp;rsquo;s data to
OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s servers, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t use it to train their future model?&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>Security&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>Is your data going to be secure on their servers? &lt;a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/chatgpt-confirms-data-breach/">It&amp;rsquo;s
not like they&amp;rsquo;ve ever had a breach&lt;/a>.&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>Censorship&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>Did Sam Altman ask the &lt;a href="https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/">underpaid kenyan workers&lt;/a> to not
let you or the LLM talk about certain things?&lt;/dd>
&lt;/dl>
&lt;p>All of these concerns are valid, and while personally I don&amp;rsquo;t care
about certain conversations being leaked or being publicly attributed
to me, I do care about the 3rd point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Favorite Little Operator</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/my-favorite-little-operator/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/my-favorite-little-operator/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sometimes, there are little things that solve so much that we take for
granted. There&amp;rsquo;s also things that solve so much that aren&amp;rsquo;t used as
often.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been relying on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_coalescing_operator">??&lt;/a>, which is a very
interesting operator called &amp;ldquo;null-coalescing operator&amp;rdquo;. A fairly
seasoned programmer probably uses it very often and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t find this
as fascinating as I did, but for me, it&amp;rsquo;s a game-changer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take this for instance:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-js" data-lang="js">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">const&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">somevar&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">null&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> (&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">somevar&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">===&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">null&lt;/span>) {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">console&lt;/span>.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">log&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;non-null value&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>} &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">else&lt;/span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">console&lt;/span>.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">log&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">somevar&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, we print out &lt;code>somevar&lt;/code>, and if it&amp;rsquo;s null, we print a string. You
can also use a ternary operator to clean it up and rewrite it like
this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ngrok SystemD Service</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/ngrok-systemd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/ngrok-systemd/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is going to be a quick post, but it&amp;rsquo;s still something that I
like. I love systemd, and try to (over)use it every time I can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is one of those use-cases where I can use &lt;a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok&lt;/a> to freely demo my
app without having to set up a cloud instance or open up a port in my
router. The simple usage of running ngrok is fine for simple cases
like hosting a minecraft server for an hour, but if you need to run it
in the background you&amp;rsquo;d need a service. This is all done without the
use of &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code> or becoming root; you just need to set up ngrok and have a
machine with systemd.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Steam Deck: The Linux User's Dream</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/steam-deck/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/steam-deck/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I received my &lt;a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/">Steam Deck&lt;/a> about -checks Steam account- 3 months
ago, I was already aware of what it was &lt;a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech">capable of&lt;/a>, considering that I
had been browsing &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/steamdeck">r/SteamDeck&lt;/a> while waiting for it. What I did &lt;span class="underline">not&lt;/span>
know was its capabilities as a Linux desktop or even server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may ask &amp;ldquo;what is so special about another Switch clone?&amp;rdquo; if you
don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is, and if you do you may ask &amp;ldquo;what is so special
about a handheld pc?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My first post</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I frankly don&amp;rsquo;t know where to begin, but I am glad you &lt;em>somehow&lt;/em> found
your way here.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why">Why&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The entire reason behind me starting this was a braindump. You may
share the same experience of gulping down a large amount of coffee,
flexing your fingers, and browsing the web or frantically coding away
at your mechanical keyboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whatever it may be, many of those great days (and nights) ended up being
wasted for not writing down what I did, learned, discovered,
regretted, etc.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
