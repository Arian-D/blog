I love systemd, and try to (over)use it every time I can.
This is one of those use-cases where I can use ngrok to freely demo my app without having to set up a cloud instance or open up a port in my router. The simple usage of running ngrok is fine for simple cases like hosting a minecraft server for an hour, but if you need to run it in the background you&amp;rsquo;d need a service.</description></item><item><title>Steam Deck: The Linux User's Dream</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/steam-deck/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/steam-deck/</guid><description>When I received my Steam Deck about -checks Steam account- 3 months ago, I was already aware of what it was capable of, considering that I had been browsing r/SteamDeck while waiting for it.

You may ask &amp;ldquo;what is so special about another Switch clone?&amp;rdquo; if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is, and if you do you may ask &amp;ldquo;what is so special about a handheld pc?</description></item><item><title>My first post</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>Hi,
I frankly don&amp;rsquo;t know where to begin, but I am glad you somehow found your way here.
Why The entire reason behind me starting this was a braindump. You may share the same experience of gulping down a large amount of coffee, flexing your fingers, and browsing the web or frantically coding away at your mechanical keyboard.
Whatever it may be, many of those great days (and nights) ended up being wasted for not writing down what I did, learned, discovered, regretted, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
