be a bit of a surprise. WSL is Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Linux subsystem for
Windows, a proprietary operating system that embeds &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftedge/forum/all/how-can-i-get-rid-of-my-login-screen-idiotically/0e7801ef-1b32-4f07-884e-ff9384c67d0b">candy crush ads&lt;/a> in
the start bar that is less stable than its alternatives, and
everything it stands for screams corporate, while GNU Guix System is a
&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">free&lt;/a> OS trying to be as pure as possible, both in terms of being
immutable and also avoiding non-free software (not just proprietary,
but also non-free source-available software). Guix is the antithesis
of Windows.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Practical shebangs</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/practical-shebang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/practical-shebang/</guid><description>&lt;p>Usually, one of the first things a Linux/Unix user learns is to create
a shell script. The process generally goes like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Write a &lt;code>script.sh&lt;/code> file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fill it with
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span>echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Hello world&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make it executable with &lt;code>chmod +x script.sh&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And finally, run it with &lt;code>./script.sh&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Nice and simple, and most *nix users are familiar with this. For an
average user, the journey ends right then and there, but if you&amp;rsquo;re
interested, you realize that there&amp;rsquo;s always ways to use and abuse the
tooling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Notes from a first con</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/notes-for-a-first-con/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/notes-for-a-first-con/</guid><description>&lt;p>I went to &lt;a href="http://defcon.org/">defcon&lt;/a> for the first time, and it was probably one of the
best experiences of my life, if not the best. Here are some
notes to self for the second time that might help another first-timer
next time around.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="talks">Talks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I only went to one, and I probably won&amp;rsquo;t go to that many next
time. Most talks are published, and while they&amp;rsquo;re the sorts of talks
that grab 100% of my attention, I feel &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO&lt;/a> watching them versus
doing things that I cannot do later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A mediocre pseudo-espresso recipe with the AeroPress</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/aeropress-recipe/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/aeropress-recipe/</guid><description>&lt;p>A real espresso requires an espresso machine, and that&amp;rsquo;s somewhat
inconvenient for an average Joe like me, because&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I can&amp;rsquo;t afford one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to spend that much money, if I could afford one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If I was willing to buy one and could afford it, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t wanna
bring it to the office, since I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to use it at home.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, what can I do? I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to pay someone to make it for me at
Starbucks, because it&amp;rsquo;s pricey and has never tasted good (to me). There are some
great &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-wave_coffee">3rd wave&lt;/a> cafe&amp;rsquo;s near me, but then again, I can&amp;rsquo;t leave the
office 5 times a day to buy a fresh shot and come back.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI on a laptop</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/ai-on-a-laptop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/ai-on-a-laptop/</guid><description>&lt;p>The AI craze is going strong. You would think it&amp;rsquo;d be over by now, but
big boy companies keep throwing their money at Nvidia GPUs and
overpriced LLM subscriptions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the average Joe, GPT4 and GPT4o are more than enough to do your
day-to-day tasks or if you&amp;rsquo;re a developer, you can just have OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s
API do everything you&amp;rsquo;re too lazy to do. This all comes at a cost:&lt;/p>
&lt;dl>
&lt;dt>Data privacy&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>Are you okay sending your or your company&amp;rsquo;s data to
OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s servers, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t use it to train their future model?&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>Security&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>Is your data going to be secure on their servers? &lt;a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/chatgpt-confirms-data-breach/">It&amp;rsquo;s
not like they&amp;rsquo;ve ever had a breach&lt;/a>.&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>Censorship&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>Did Sam Altman ask the &lt;a href="https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/">underpaid kenyan workers&lt;/a> to not
let you or the LLM talk about certain things?&lt;/dd>
&lt;/dl>
&lt;p>All of these concerns are valid, and while personally I don&amp;rsquo;t care
about certain conversations being leaked or being publicly attributed
to me, I do care about the 3rd point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Favorite Little Operator</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/my-favorite-little-operator/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/my-favorite-little-operator/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sometimes, there are little things that solve so much that we take for
granted. There&amp;rsquo;s also things that solve so much that aren&amp;rsquo;t used as
often.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been relying on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_coalescing_operator">??&lt;/a>, which is a very
interesting operator called &amp;ldquo;null-coalescing operator&amp;rdquo;. A fairly
seasoned programmer probably uses it very often and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t find this
as fascinating as I did, but for me, it&amp;rsquo;s a game-changer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take this for instance:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-js" data-lang="js">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">const&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">somevar&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">null&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> (&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">somevar&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">===&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">null&lt;/span>) {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">console&lt;/span>.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">log&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;non-null value&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>} &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">else&lt;/span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">console&lt;/span>.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">log&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">somevar&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, we print out &lt;code>somevar&lt;/code>, and if it&amp;rsquo;s null, we print a string. You
can also use a ternary operator to clean it up and rewrite it like
this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ngrok SystemD Service</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/ngrok-systemd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/ngrok-systemd/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is going to be a quick post, but it&amp;rsquo;s still something that I
like. I love systemd, and try to (over)use it every time I can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is one of those use-cases where I can use &lt;a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok&lt;/a> to freely demo my
app without having to set up a cloud instance or open up a port in my
router. The simple usage of running ngrok is fine for simple cases
like hosting a minecraft server for an hour, but if you need to run it
in the background you&amp;rsquo;d need a service. This is all done without the
use of &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code> or becoming root; you just need to set up ngrok and have a
machine with systemd.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Steam Deck: The Linux User's Dream</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/steam-deck/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/steam-deck/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I received my &lt;a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/">Steam Deck&lt;/a> about -checks Steam account- 3 months
ago, I was already aware of what it was &lt;a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech">capable of&lt;/a>, considering that I
had been browsing &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/steamdeck">r/SteamDeck&lt;/a> while waiting for it. What I did &lt;span class="underline">not&lt;/span>
know was its capabilities as a Linux desktop or even server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may ask &amp;ldquo;what is so special about another Switch clone?&amp;rdquo; if you
don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is, and if you do you may ask &amp;ldquo;what is so special
about a handheld pc?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My first post</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I frankly don&amp;rsquo;t know where to begin, but I am glad you &lt;em>somehow&lt;/em> found
your way here.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why">Why&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The entire reason behind me starting this was a braindump. You may
share the same experience of gulping down a large amount of coffee,
flexing your fingers, and browsing the web or frantically coding away
at your mechanical keyboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whatever it may be, many of those great days (and nights) ended up being
wasted for not writing down what I did, learned, discovered,
regretted, etc.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
