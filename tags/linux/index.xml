like. I love systemd, and try to (over)use it every time I can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is one of those use-cases where I can use &lt;a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok&lt;/a> to freely demo my
app without having to set up a cloud instance or open up a port in my
router. The simple usage of running ngrok is fine for simple cases
like hosting a minecraft server for an hour, but if you need to run it
in the background you&amp;rsquo;d need a service. This is all done without the
use of &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code> or becoming root; you just need to set up ngrok and have a
machine with systemd.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Steam Deck: The Linux User's Dream</title><link>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/steam-deck/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://arian-d.github.io/blog/posts/steam-deck/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I received my &lt;a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/">Steam Deck&lt;/a> about -checks Steam account- 3 months
ago, I was already aware of what it was &lt;a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech">capable of&lt;/a>, considering that I
had been browsing &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/steamdeck">r/SteamDeck&lt;/a> while waiting for it. What I did &lt;span class="underline">not&lt;/span>
know was its capabilities as a Linux desktop or even server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may ask &amp;ldquo;what is so special about another Switch clone?&amp;rdquo; if you
don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is, and if you do you may ask &amp;ldquo;what is so special
about a handheld pc?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
