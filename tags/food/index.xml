inconvenient for an average Joe like me, because&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I can&amp;rsquo;t afford one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to spend that much money, if I could afford one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If I was willing to buy one and could afford it, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t wanna
bring it to the office, since I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to use it at home.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, what can I do? I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to pay someone to make it for me at
Starbucks, because it&amp;rsquo;s pricey and has never tasted good (to me). There are some
great &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-wave_coffee">3rd wave&lt;/a> cafe&amp;rsquo;s near me, but then again, I can&amp;rsquo;t leave the
office 5 times a day to buy a fresh shot and come back.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
