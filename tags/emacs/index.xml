The boomer-coded text editor definition of a grid
of bytes is just not enough. Code has structure, tooling, footguns
(especially when it&amp;rsquo;s a dynamically typed language), and many other
attributes that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be edited by typing &lt;code&gt;vi code.py&lt;/code&gt; into a
console and expecting things to be done in a timely manner while not
making mistakes. It simply is not possible by a bad developer like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started to &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt; code, I was already in college and LSPs
were a thing. While IDEs are things I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with and use, LSPs
bridge 90% of the gap. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve read on the interwebs, the
IDE-only era was grim, and text editors that had genuine advantages
(Emacs for extensibility and Vim for efficient editing) had their own
matrix of extensions that provided a subpar experience. There were
hacks for IDE-like features like &lt;a href="https://github.com/haskell/ghcide"&gt;ghcide&lt;/a&gt;, but they were never
sufficient, and those hacks were for &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wagie"&gt;corpowagie&lt;/a&gt;s (who didn&amp;rsquo;t write
Haskell).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
